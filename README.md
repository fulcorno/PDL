# PDL
PDL (Picture Description Language) - a vector language for simple PostScript drawings [discontinued]

This is a small compiler for a custom language called PDL, that was developed to create some vector images to be inserted in my M.S. thesis. The program is able to outpus an Encapsulated PostScript file, that may be inserted into a LaTeX document.

The project is discontinued, and obsolete. The code is donated to the public domain.
